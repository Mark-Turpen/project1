                    I'm majoring in computer engineering and minoring in
                    mathmatics at Texas A&M University.

                    3D graphics and GPU programming are of perticular interest to me.
                    I created a raytraced WebGL visualization of a black hole
                    the looks quit similar to the black hole in the movie
                    Interstellar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrote a raytraced game engine using the Metal graphics api
                    that supports reflection, refraction, shadows, and diffusion
                    (separation of colors that prisms cause).  The engine also
                    supports portals like thoes seen in the game Portal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrote an iOS app that uses Metal compute shaders to perform
                    real-time image editing operations on the live camera feed.
                    The operations include negatives, chromatic abberation,
                    affine transformations, as well as blurring, sharpening,
                    and edge detection convolutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality facinates me.  I created an iOS app that
                    allows you to create drawings in 3D that look like they're
                    in real world because they are rendered and composited
                    into the camera feed.  All you need to do to draw is press
                    a button and wave your iPhone as if it were a paint brush.
                </p>

                    I'm familiar with assembly programming in both x86 and ARM.
                    I have used it to implemented fast floating point exponientals
                    and logarithms as well as more tradional algorithms like merge
                    sort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have written a C++ vector class that links with raw assembly
                    that uses SIMD instructions to parallelize vector operations like
                    addition, subtraction, dot products, length, and normalization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrote a userspace multithreading library in C that uses assembly to
                    perform context switching and spinlock thread synchrozation.  It
                    includes a custom round robin scheduler.  The library only
                    depends on the kernel for timer interrupts.  The kernel depends
                    on a hardware timer for the same purpose.
                </p>

                    When I was a kid, I wanted to be a physicist.  Later, I
                    found out that its a dead field; however, my interest
                    persists.  I wrote a 3D rigid body physics simulation
                    similar to thoes used in video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a simulation of electro-magnetic waves that models
                    wave reflection, refraction, and diffraction as seen in
                    the double slit experiment.  It works by iteratively solving
                    the wave differential equation.
